Bukkit
======
A plugin API for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) servers, currently maintained by [SpigotMC](http://www.spigotmc.org/).

Bug Reporting
-------------
The development team is very open to both bug and feature requests / suggestions. You can submit these on the [JIRA Issue Tracker](http://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/).

Compilation
-----------
Bukkit is a Java program which uses [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) for compilation. To compile fresh from Git, simply perform the following steps:

* Install Maven and Git using your preferred installation methods.
* `git clone https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/scm/spigot/bukkit.git`.
* `mvn clean install`.
 
Some IDEs such as [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/) can perform these steps for you. Any Maven capable Java IDE can be used to develop with Bukkit, however the current team's personal preference is to use NetBeans.

Contributing
------------
Contributions of all sorts are welcome. To manage community contributions, we use the pull request functionality of Stash. In to gain access to Stash and create a pull request, you will first need to perform the following steps:

* Create an account on [JIRA](http://hub.spigotmc.org/jira/).

Once you have performed these steps you can create a fork, push your code changes, and then submit it for review.
